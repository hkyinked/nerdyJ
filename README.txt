
This is Dimension, a fun little portfolio resume of myself with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Want to work together please feel free to contact me!
